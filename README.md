## Trabalho 1 - Adaline Model

This project implements the Adaline Perceptron used to classify an 8x8 input into two shapes: ⋀ and ⋁

A training set (from trainingset.txt) is used to train the model, and then the model is evaluated on the test set.

After that, a UI shows up which allows the user to draw a figure on a canvas and have it classified by the same perceptron.
